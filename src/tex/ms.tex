\begin{abstract}
    This document is meant to be used as a lose guide.
    It includes useful and basic packages and formatting tips to keep you from hunting for formatting code while writing.
    Please use this as a reference, and especially while writing without a specific journal already in mind.
    This will not be the format all journals accept, so please use their defined style guides when work on your draft.
    % Additionally, it's very nice to keep all your sentences on different lines.
    % It makes editing a lot easier.
\end{abstract}

\section{Basic Format and Style}

\subsection{Format}

The specific format of the paper if between you and your journal and your editors.
However, it is a good idea to include the basic sections of "Introduction, Methods, Conclusions".

\subsection{Style}

Names of coding packages denoted with: \texttt{Package}.



\editor{Here is an quick comment that may appear, indicating an addition by an editor.}

\subsubsection{Tables}

Tables should act as summaries, and include error bars when applicable. Captions should draw attention to the main takeaway and can provide analysis, but not necessary give a full summary.
Please view sample table formats in the appendix ~\ref{tab:two_column}




\subsubsection{Plots and other graphics}

When making graphics, please keep accessibility in mind.
All plots should be understandable in both black and white and color.
This requires things like using color blind friendly color packages (matplotlib's virdis for example), and changing line and marker styles for different elements of a graph.
Plots also must be clearly labeled and include legends where applicable.
Captions should both describe what the figure contains and its significance.

When referencing a figure in the main text, please refer to it with \verb|~\ref{figure label}|.
Please view different figure layouts in the appendix ~\ref{fig:single_graphic_figure}.



\subsubsection{Equations}

Large equations should be numbered and included in an equation block such that
\begin{align}
    E=mc^2 \label{eq:1} \\
    F=ma \label{eq:2}
\end{align}


Intermediate steps can not include numbers such that
\begin{align*}
    A = \pi r^2
\end{align*}

Or by using:

\begin{align}
    A
        &=B         \label{eq:3}\\
        &=B         \notag\\
    A
        &=BCD       \label{eq:4}\\
        &=B         \notag
\end{align}


Labels are used so that they can be referenced later on using the command \verb|~\ref{eq:equation label}|.  Singular symbols can be added into the middle of sentences using \verb|$\symbol$|, such that \verb|\pi| becomes $\pi$.
